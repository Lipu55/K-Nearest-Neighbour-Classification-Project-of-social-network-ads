Social Network Ads Classification: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Analysis for Predictive Modeling
# In this project, the objective is to perform classification of social network ads using the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for predictive modeling. KNN is a non-parametric machine learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on their proximity to the labeled training data.By applying the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify social network ads, this project aims to provide predictive modeling capabilities for future ad outcomes. The results can assist marketing teams and advertisers in making data-driven decisions, optimizing ad targeting strategies, and improving the effectiveness of their ad campaigns.
